# mod3_project

This repo contains:
* Description of the project in a PDF
* Three python starter files
* Three test files
* A starter jupyter notebook

Authors:
Joe Read and Mohammed Hannan

Dataset:
London TfL Bikepoint data combined with London geographical data.
We want to look at how the location of the bikepoint influences the condition
of the bikepoint. We will use the geographical data to see if the population
statistics have an impact on the usage of the bikepoint.

Hypotheses:
A Faulty bikepoints will have more faulty bikepoints near it. 
H0 = Faulty bikepoints have the same number of faulty bikepoints near-by as general bikepoints
H1 = Faulty bikepoints have more faulty bikepoints near them than general bikepoints

Bikepoints at a high elevation are smaller.
H0 = Bikepoints on hills have the same number of docks as general bikepoints
H1= Bikepoints on hills have fewer docks than general bikepoints

Bikepoints in high populated areas are more often faulty.
H0 = Bikepoints in highly populated areas have the same number of faulty docks as general bikepoints
H1 = Bikepoints in highly populated areas have more faulty docks

Higher populated areas have more larger bikepoints
H0 = Bikepoints in highly populated areas have the same number of docks as general bikepoints
H1 = Bikepoints in highly populated areas have more docks than general bikepoints

APIS:
TfL BikePoint API.
Data Science Toolkit Coords to Statistics API.
